Files that are used for preparing a baseball team to face opponents

ScoutingReport.py is intended to process a potentially large database of pitches thrown by opposing pitcher. The code identifies players with similar statistics to a batter of choice, and uses the at bats of these similar hitters 
against the opposing pitcher to visualize pitch frequency, broken down by count

LocTrak_temp.py is intended to take a constant stream of video from the centerfield camera angle and create a dataset of the intended location of each pitch by tracking the catchers glove.
